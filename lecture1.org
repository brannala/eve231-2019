* Course Objectives
** The ``Scientific Method''
- Observations/Intuition + Induction = Hypothesis 
- Hypothesis + Deduction = Predictions 
- Predictions + Data = Accept/Reject Hypothesis
** The Role of Statistics
- Build a statistical model representing a hypothesis
- Infer unknown model parameters using data
- Test alternative hypotheses (models) using data
- Data exploration (induction)
** Topics 
- The unix operating system
- Data formats, files, incremental backup (git)
- Editing (emacs) and manipulating data (grep, etc)
- Basic programming in R, Python and unix shells
- Measurement errors (propagation in calculations)
- Probability, random variables, simulation
- Statistical models and parameters
- Parameter estimation and hypothesis tests
* Course Logistics
** Office Hours: 
*** Location: Storer Hall Rm 5339
*** Time: Tues/Thurs 16:30 - 17:30 or by appointment
** Grading:
*** P/NP based on project and presentation
*** Project will propose an experimental design and methods for statistical analysis of results 
*** Presentations will be 15 minutes (+ 5 mins for questions) describing project proposal 
* Course Requirements
** Computer running a unix operating system
*** Linux 
- Install a debian linux distribution on a PC. I recommend installing Ubuntu. Notes on Canvas for single (linux) or dual-boot (Windows+linux).
- Install class software by running an apt installer script. Notes on Canvas.
*** Mac OSX
- Mac OSX is a unix operating system -- access it through the terminal application (notes on Canvas)
- Install Homebrew package manager and run brew installer script. Notes on Canvas.
